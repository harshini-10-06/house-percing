# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts house prices using a machine learning model built with Linear Regression.

## Project Overview
The model is trained on a synthetic dataset consisting of house features such as:
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Area in square feet
- House age

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Involved
1. Import required libraries
2. Create synthetic dataset
3. Perform data analysis
4. Visualize house price distribution
5. Split dataset into training and testing sets
6. Train Linear Regression model
7. Evaluate model using RMSE and R² score
8. Predict house price for custom input

## Output
- Predicted house prices
- Model performance metrics (RMSE, R²)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a simple end-to-end machine learning workflow suitable for beginners.
